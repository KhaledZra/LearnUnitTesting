Work through the tasks creating a new test for each.
You can create a new Confirm method on your booking for each test
e.g.
Confirm1
Confirm2

Try to verify using the most appropriate assertion available.
Remember to use TDD and write the test first, starting with the assertion.
If any task is unclear or you need a hint, ask the product owner (me!).
